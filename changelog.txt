Changes for ReqProc 3.0:
- Completely overhauled how function inputs and outputs are handling; functions now have signatures and input/output types; this also means that native functions no longer have to check the stack for the values they're expecting, the runtime does it for them
- Added anonymous function declaration
- Added the "native" type for FFI reasons
- Functions no longer need to be explicitly called with `&` (e.g. `&io.putl` -> `io.putl`)
- Added the `__init__` module, which is loaded into each scope at interpreter initialization
  - the `exit` function has been moved here
- Added the `runtime` module
- ReqProc is now versioned
- Negative numbers are now supported (this is why testing is important)
- Added many tests
- Added localized error handling via `try` and `notry`, which begin and end a try block respectively
- Added a REPL
- The file to interpret is now passed in through the '-f' flag
- Added the '-t' flag, which dumps the tokens generated by the lexer
- Native functions now accept a `callf` parameter to allow for the calling of functions popped off the stack
